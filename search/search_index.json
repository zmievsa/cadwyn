It can also be used as reference documentation until we have a proper one. First, let's talk about the reasons for using Cadwyn at all.</p> <p>Cadwyn aims to be the most accurate and sophisticated API Versioning model out there. First of all, you maintain zero duplicated code yourself. Usually, in API versioning you would need to duplicate and maintain at least some layer of your application. It could be the database, business logic, schemas, and endpoints. With Cadwyn you avoid duplicating any of that. Internally, it duplicates endpoints and schemas at runtime but none of it becomes your tech debt, none of it becomes your code to support. If you test rigorously, then only some small subset of your tests will need to be duplicated when existing functionality is changed between versions.</p> <p>You define your database, business logic, routes, and schemas only once. Then, whenever you release a new API version, you use Cadwyn's version change DSL to describe how to convert your app to the previous version. So your business logic and database stay intact and always represent the latest version while the version changes make sure that your clients can continue using the previous versions without ever needing to update their code.</p> <p>This allows you to effortlessly maintain hundreds of versions, unlike any other API versioning approach.</p>"},{"location":"concepts/api_version_parameter/","title":"API version parameter","text":"<p>Cadwyn adds another routing layer to FastAPI by default: by a version parameter.

We have altered our schemas -- that's great! But when our clients send us requests using the old versions of our API -- we will still get the data where we have <code>creation_date</code> instead of <code>created_at</code>. How do we solve this? Well, in Cadwyn your business logic never receives requests of the old versions. Instead, it receives only the requests of the latest version. So when you define a version change that renames a field, you need to also define how to convert the request body from the old version to the newer version. For example:</p> <pre><code>from cadwyn import (\n    RequestInfo,\n    VersionChange,\n    convert_request_to_next_version_for,\n    schema,\n)\nfrom invoices import InvoiceCreateRequest\n\n\nclass RemoveTaxIdEndpoints(VersionChange):\n    description = \"Rename `Invoice.creation_date` to `Invoice.created_at`.\"\n    instructions_to_migrate_to_previous_version = (\n        schema(InvoiceCreateRequest)\n        .field(\"creation_date\")\n        .had(name=\"created_at\"),\n    )\n\n    @convert_request_to_next_version_for(InvoiceCreateRequest)\n    def rename_creation_date_to_created_at(request: RequestInfo):\n        request.body[\"created_at\"] = request.body.pop(\"creation_date\")\n</code></pre> <p>Did you notice how the schema for <code>InvoiceCreateRequest</code> is specified in our migration? This signals Cadwyn to apply it to all routes with this schema as their body.</p> <p>Now we have not only described how schemas changed but we have also described how to migrate a request of the old version to the new version. When Cadwyn receives a request targeting a particular version, the request is first validated against the schema of that particular version. Then Cadwyn applies all request migrations until the latest version to migrate the request to latest. So now your business logic receives the latest version of the request yet for your clients you have two versions of your API -- you have added variability without introducing any complexity into your business logic.</p> <p>But wait... What happens to the <code>Invoice</code> responses? Your business logic will now return <code>created_at</code> so your clients from old versions will be affected. Cadwyn has a tool for that too: we migrate our responses as well. Requests were migrated forward in versions while responses are migrated backward in versions. So your business logic returns a response of the latest version and Cadwyn will use your response migrations to migrate it back to the version of your client's request:</p> <pre><code>from cadwyn import (\n    RequestInfo,\n    ResponseInfo,\n    VersionChange,\n    convert_request_to_next_version_for,\n    convert_response_to_previous_version_for,\n    schema,\n)\nfrom invoices import (\n    BaseInvoice,\n    InvoiceCreateRequest,\n    InvoiceResource,\n)\n\n\nclass RemoveTaxIdEndpoints(VersionChange):\n    description = \"Rename `Invoice.creation_date` to `Invoice.created_at`.\"\n    instructions_to_migrate_to_previous_version = (\n        schema(BaseInvoice).field(\"creation_date\").had(name=\"created_at\"),\n    )\n\n    @convert_request_to_next_version_for(InvoiceCreateRequest)\n    def rename_creation_date_to_created_at(request: RequestInfo):\n        request.body[\"created_at\"] = request.body.pop(\"creation_date\")\n\n    @convert_response_to_previous_version_for(InvoiceResource)\n    def rename_created_at_to_creation_date(response: ResponseInfo):\n        response.body[\"creation_date\"] = response.body.pop(\"created_at\")\n</code></pre> <p>Did you notice how the schema for <code>InvoiceResource</code> is specified in our migration? This signals Cadwyn to apply it to all routes with this schema as their <code>response_model</code>. Notice also that we now use <code>BaseInvoice</code> in our instructions -- imagine it is the parent of both <code>InvoiceCreateRequest</code> and <code>InvoiceResource</code> so renaming it there will rename it in these schemas as well. You can, however, apply the instructions to both individual schemas instead of their parent if you want to.</p> <p>Now our request comes, Cadwyn migrates it to the latest version using our request migration, then we do our business logic, return the latest response from it, and Cadwyn migrates it back to the request version. Does our business logic or database know about the fact that we have two versions? No, not at all. It is zero-cost. Consider the benefits of supporting not just two, but two hundred versions.</p> <p></p> <p>Notice how the latest versions of our schemas are used in our migration -- this pattern can be found everywhere in Cadwyn.

Old data is also going to be affected: if old users had multiple addresses, we will only be able to return one of them. This is important: a breaking change has been introduced.</p> <p>In order to solve this issue, Cadwyn uses a concept of internal representations. An internal representation of your data is like a database entry of your data -- it is its latest version plus all the fields that are incompatible with the latest API version. If we were talking about classes, then internal representation would be a child of your latest schemas -- it has all the same data and a little more, it expands its functionality. Essentially your internal representation of user object can contain much more data than your latest schemas.</p> <p>So all your requests get migrated to HEAD, which is the internal representation of latest -- but not exactly the latest itself. So its data is really similar to latest. The same applies to your responses: you do not respond with and migrate from the latest version of your data, you respond with its internal representation which is really close to the actual latest schemas.</p> <p>In responses, returning the internal representation is simple: return your database model or a dict with everything you need for all your versions. In the user address example, it is recommended to continue storing the list of addresses in the database and add a single address to a response.

For example, if you have a dependency that checks whether a user exists in the database, it will be executed twice. This is not an issue if the dependency is idempotent, but it becomes one if it is not.</p> <p>To solve this issue, you can use the <code>cadwyn.current_dependency_solver</code> dependency which tells you whether your dependency is getting called before or after the request is migrated. If you want to run it once we migrated the request to the latest version, you should only run it when <code>current_dependency_solver</code> is <code>\"cadwyn\"</code>.

In such cases, it is tempting to add a version check and just follow the new business logic such as:</p> <pre><code># This is wrong. Please, do not do this.\nif api_version_var.get() &gt;= date(2022, 11, 11):\n    # do new logic here\n    ...\n</code></pre> <p>Instead, Cadwyn provides a special <code>VersionChangeWithSideEffects</code> class for handling such cases. It makes finding dangerous versions that have side effects much easier and provides a nice abstraction for checking whether we are on a version where these side effects have been applied.</p> <p>As an example, let's use the tutorial section's case with the user and their address. Let's say we use an external service to check whether user's address is listed in it and return 400 response if it is not. Let's also say that we only added this check in the newest version.</p> <pre><code>from cadwyn import VersionChangeWithSideEffects\n\n\nclass UserAddressIsCheckedInExternalService(VersionChangeWithSideEffects):\n    description = (\n        \"User's address is now checked for existence in an external service. \"\n        \"If it doesn't exist there, a 400 code is returned.\"\n    )\n</code></pre> <p>Then we will have the following check in our business logic:</p> <pre><code>from src.versions import versions, UserAddressIsCheckedInExternalService\n\n\nasync def create_user(payload):\n    if UserAddressIsCheckedInExternalService.is_applied:\n        check_user_address_exists_in_an_external_service(payload.address)\n    ...\n</code></pre> <p>So this change can be contained in any version.

Are you sure you MUST change your business logic? Are you sure whatever you are trying to do cannot just be done by a migration? 90% of time, you will not need them. Please, think twice before using them. API Versioning is about having the same underlying app and data while changing the schemas and api endpoints to interact with it. By introducing side effects, you leak versioning into your business logic and possibly even your data which makes your code significantly harder to maintain in the long term. If each side effect adds a single <code>if</code> to your logic, then after 100 versions with side effects, you will have 100 more <code>if</code>s. If used correctly, Cadwyn helps you maintain decades\u2019 worth of API versions with minimal maintenance effort, and side effects make it significantly harder to do. Changes in the underlying source, structure, or logic of your data should not affect your API or public-facing business logic.</p> <p>However, the following use cases often necessitate side effects.</p>"},{"location":"home/CHANGELOG/","title":"Changelog","text":"<p>All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

To prevent that, introduce API versioning. There aren't many methods of doing that. Most of them force you to either duplicate your schemas, your endpoints, or your entire app instance. And it makes sense, really: duplication is the only way to make sure that you will not break old versions with your new versions; the bigger the piece you are duplicating, the safer. Of course, the safest being duplicating the entire app instance and even having a separate database. But that is expensive and makes it either impossible to make breaking changes often or to support many versions. As a result, either you need infinite resources, very long development cycles, or your users need to migrate often from version to version.</p> <p>Stripe has come up with a solution: to have one HEAD app version whose responses get migrated to older versions and to describe changes between these versions using migrations. This approach allows Stripe to keep versions for years without dropping them. Obviously, each breaking change still hurts and each version still makes the system more complex and expensive, but their approach gives you a chance to minimize this complexity. Additionally, it allows you to backport features and bugfixes to older versions. However, you will also be backporting bugs, which is a sad consequence of eliminating duplication.</p> <p>Assume you need to know what your code looked like two weeks ago. You may use <code>git checkout</code> or <code>git reset</code> with an older commit because <code>git</code> stores the latest version of your code (which is also called HEAD) and the differences between it and each previous version as a chain of changes. This is exactly how Stripe's approach works. They store the latest version and use the diffs to regenerate the older versions.</p> <p>Cadwyn is built upon this approach, so let's continue with the tutorial and combine the two versions that were created using versioning.</p> Note to curious readers    Git doesn't actually work this way internally.

Essentially version changes describe the difference between the latest version and the previous version. They are a way to say \"Okay, we have applied the breaking changes but here is how we would revert these changes for our old clients\".</p> <p>For every endpoint whose <code>response_model</code> is <code>UserResource</code>, this migration will convert the list of addresses back to a single address when migrating to the previous version.
