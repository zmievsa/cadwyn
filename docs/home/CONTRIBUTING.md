# Contribution Guide

## Setting up the environment

* The lowest currently supported version is Python 3.10. You should use
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage multiple Python
versions on your system.
* We maintain a Makefile with several commands to help with common tasks.

1. Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
2. Run `uv sync` to create a virtual environment and install the required development dependencies
3. Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) using uv: `uv tool install pre-commit`
4. Run `pre-commit install --install-hooks` to install pre-commit hooks

## Code contributions

### Workflow

1. [Fork](https://github.com/zmievsa/cadwyn/fork) the [Cadwyn repository](https://github.com/zmievsa/cadwyn)
2. Clone your fork locally with git
3. [Set up the environment](#setting-up-the-environment)
4. Make your changes
5. Commit your changes to git.
6. Open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests). Give the pull request a descriptive title indicating what it changes.
7. Add yourself as a contributor using the [all-contributors bot](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage)

## Guidelines for writing code

* Code should be [Pythonic and zen](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/)
* All code should be fully [typed](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/). This is enforced via [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) but the type hinting itself will be enforced by [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/) in the future.
  * When requiring complex types, use a [type alias](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#type-aliases).
  * If something cannot be typed correctly due to a limitation of the type checkers, you may use [typing.cast](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.cast) to rectify the situation. However, you should only use as a last resort if you've exhausted all other options of [type narrowing](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/type_narrowing.html), such as [isinstance()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance) checks and [type guards](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.TypeGuard)
  * You may use `pyright: ignore` if you ensured that a line is correct, but pyright has issues with it.
* If you are adding or modifying existing code, ensure that it's fully tested. 100% test coverage is mandatory, and will be checked on the PR using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
* When adding a new public interface, it has to be included in the concept documentation located in `docs/concepts.md`. If applicable, add or modify examples in the docs related to the new functionality implemented.

### Writing and running tests

Tests are contained within the `tests` directory, and follow roughly the same
directory structure as the `cadwyn` module. If you are adding a test
case, it should be located within the correct submodule of `tests`. E.g.
tests for `cadwyn/codegen.py` reside in `tests/codegen`.

`make test` to run tests located in `tests`

### Running type checkers

We use [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/) to enforce type safety.
You can run it with:

`uv run pyright .`

## Project documentation

The documentation is located in the `/docs` directory and is all in
[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

### Docs theme and appearance

We welcome contributions that enhance / improve the appearance and usability of the docs. We use [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) If you wish to contribute to the docs style / setup, or static site generation, you should consult the theme docs as a first step.

### Running the docs locally

Then you can serve the documentation with `mkdocs serve`

### Writing and editing docs

We welcome contributions that enhance / improve the content of the docs. Feel free to add examples, clarify text, restructure the docs, etc., but make sure to follow these guidelines:

* Write text in idiomatic English, using simple language
* Opt for [Oxford commas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) when listing a series of terms
* Keep examples simple and self contained
* Provide links where applicable
